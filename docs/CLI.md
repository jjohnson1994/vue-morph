# CLI

Each command should be prefixed with either `yarn` or `npm`.

*The CLI presumes that the Android SDK is installed at ~/Library/Android/sdk/. This may cause issues on some machine as a check will be put in place in the future.*

## Commands

``` console
create-app:android
```
Create a new Android App in *app/android*

``` console
build-app:android
```
Build the Vue project and bundle it in into the Android app.

``` console
emulate:android
```
